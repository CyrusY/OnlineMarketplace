# OnlineMarketplace
Group Project for CSCI3100 - Software Engineering (2021 Spring, CUHK)


All work programmed in Javascript
we are using MERN stack to implement. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.


    
    

## Setup
In order to run the web application Run locally, you may first clone the main repository. And input the following commends:


```sh
cd /online-marketplace
npm install
cd /backend
npm install
nodemon server 
```
next, open a new terminal and write commend:

```sh
open a new terminal and write commend:   
cd /online-marketplace  
npm start  
```

The application is currently using the `.env` file to embed the API key in the
HTML document. This is a temporary key and is not valid for production usage. It
can be replaced by following these instructions to
[get an api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
